# basedBinary
A simple console cpp program that converts base 2 numbers to every other base.
####### I am a Computer Science student currently in sem 1 and honestly I'm just frustrated to convert from every other bases to base 2, so heres a program that converts from base n to base 2

###### supports -> Base 16, 10, 8 
###### I will add the base 2 to other base convert functionality in this program as well
